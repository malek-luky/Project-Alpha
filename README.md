## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for Project Alpha, a bachelor thesis project conducted at the Czech Technical University in Prague. This project focuses on the development and implementation of a thrust vector controlled rocket model. This README.md provides an overview of the project, its materials, and a brief disclaimer regarding the use of the flight software.

## Material
### Flight Computer
- **Barometer**: BMP388
- **Orientation Sensor**: BNO055
- **Microcontroller**: Teensy 4.1

### Additional Hardware
- **Servo Motor**: SG92R
- **Rocket Motor**: Klima D3-P

## 3D Model
The 3D model files included in this repository are essential for printing the rocket. These files come in both STL and Autodesk Inventor formats, providing flexibility for users. The rocket model was specifically designed to accommodate a custom PCB and has been printed using ASA material.

## Flight Software
**Important:** The flight software provided in this repository is experimental and should be used at your own risk. It is intended to serve as a reference and a starting point for your own projects or research related to thrust vector controlled rocketry. Make sure to thoroughly test and validate any modifications you make to the software before using it for an actual rocket launch.

The flight software includes code for controlling the rocket's flight based on data from the sensors and the servo motor. It is designed to assist in achieving thrust vector control, a critical aspect of rocket stability during flight.

## Disclaimer
Launching the rocket based on the mentioned steps and utilizing the flight software is entirely at your own risk. This repository is meant to provide inspiration and study material for educational purposes and research. It is not intended as a comprehensive guide or a guarantee of a fully working prototype.

Safety is paramount when dealing with rocketry, and it is essential to adhere to all safety regulations and guidelines established by your local authorities. Always conduct thorough testing and follow best practices to ensure the safety of yourself and others involved in the project.
